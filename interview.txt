She begun her studies in Math and generals fields.But She would sooner work on computer science field.
She has 2 passion :computer science ,in particular programation , and Art ,that is why after years of 
professional experiances on several field of computer science (programming with assembler , Haskell,
fortran ..) she studied in Ecole du Louvre ,when she came to France.She is now an expert of website composition
